** Life of a vulnerability

- vulnerability definition
- how vulnerable servers are found
- https://www.shodan.io/

** CSP (1)

- new header (*content-security-policy*), which can eg:
  + load assets only from a certain source
  + disable the use of inline <script>
  + disable http assets on HTTPS pages
- preventing clickjacking, cross-site-scripting and more
- getting standardized
- can be fully enabled or just in *report mode*
    
** CSP (2)

** The update framework

From the Head of Security at Docker.

- we are screwed
- most package managers are insecure (except for Docker)
- delegate power through a hierarchy of keys
- sign with multiple keys


** OpenBSD and pledge

- principle of least priviledge
- declare the permissions that a program has *once for all*

** DNS

- principle of least priviledge
- CSP limitations
- work in progress in improving CSP

** Erlang

- actor model invented in 1973
  + send message
  + create other actors
  + process message

- actors share nothings
- sanity in a sea of complexity
- 1986 Erlang was created
- Erlang scales vertically and horizontally
- Let it crash
- Share nothing

** Stateful containers

** Cern collider
