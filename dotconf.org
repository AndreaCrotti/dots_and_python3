** CSP (1)

- new header (*content-security-policy*), which can eg:
  + load assets only from a certain source
  + disable the use of inline <script>
  + disable http assets on HTTPS pages
- preventing clickjacking, cross-site-scripting and more
- getting standardized
- can be fully enabled or just in *report mode*
    
** CSP (2)

** The update framework

From the Head of Security at Docker.

- we are screwed
- most package managers are insecure (except for Docker)
- delegate power through a hierarchy of keys
- sign with multiple keys


** OpenBSD and pledge

- principle of least priviledge
- declare the permissions that a program has *once for all*

** DNS
