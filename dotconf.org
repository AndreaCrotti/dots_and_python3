* Dotconferences

- new format of conferences
- organised in Paris
- talks from top notch speakers
- in beautiful theathers

** Fancy

** Arguments

* Dotsecurity

** https / letsencrypt

- certificates massive PITAs
- revoked certificates *not handled*
- millions of certificates in 1 month
- wide and fast adoption

** Life of a vulnerability

- vulnerability definition
- how vulnerable servers are found
- https://www.shodan.io/
- live demo exploiting a vulnerability

** Multi Factor Authentication

Talk from Jacob Kaplan-Moss.

- user and password not enough anymore
- difference between soft and hard tokens
- ask MFA not *just* when logging in, but whenever the user does certain operations
- have a clear backup plan in place

** Lightning talks

Every time you use *sudo* God kills a squirrel.

** CSP (1)

- new header (*content-security-policy*), which can eg:
  + load assets only from a certain source
  + disable the use of inline <script>
  + disable http assets on HTTPS pages
- preventing clickjacking, cross-site-scripting and more
- getting standardized
- can be fully enabled or just in *report mode*
    
** CSP (2)

** The update framework

From the Head of Security at Docker.

- we are screwed
- most package managers are insecure (except for Docker)
- delegate power through a hierarchy of keys
- sign with multiple keys


** OpenBSD and pledge

- principle of least priviledge
- declare the permissions that a program has *once for all*

** DNS


#+begin_quote
Hardware is like milk, you want it as fresh as possible.
Software is like wine, it you want it aged.
#+end_quote

** Web Platform Security


- principle of least priviledge
- CSP limitations
- work in progress in improving CSP

** Takeaways

- letsencrypt
- [[https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/#toggle-id-7][yubi key]] for hardware security


* Dotscale

** Erlang

- actor model invented in 1973
  + send message
  + create other actors
  + process message

- actors share nothings
- sanity in a sea of complexity
- 1986 Erlang was created
- Erlang scales vertically and horizontally
- Let it crash
- Share nothing

** Stateful containers

- stateful containers are hard
- docker state done with volumes
- moving stateful containers between different clouds is hard
- need a *hybridized* container volume snapshotter

** Cern collider

** Economics and scaling

- look at how to maximize the profit
- data value grows logarithmically

- cost of development for scale used to grow almost exponentially, now
  thanks to the cloud it's not like that anymore

- teams should be small to not have excessive communication but to avoid
  too much coordination

** MongoDB presentation

** Takeaways

- consider even more asynchronous computation
